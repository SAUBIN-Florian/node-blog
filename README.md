# 2021 Project Blog Node

With this project, the focus was on fetching data from a distant server side's API. Using Node JS for creating a CRUD app, encrypted password system with Bcrypt library and store the data with MongoDB.

For the Front side i used React with React-router to display the different articles from the data, fetched with the axios library.

I also implemented a 'login checker' with the React built-in reducer (useReducer) and store the action on local storage.
